# Web APIs with .NET

## March 20-22 2023

This will be a _monorepo_ for all the code and notes we create for the Web APIs with .NET Course.

The instructor will put all of his code/notes in the `instructor` folder. Each student will _fork_ this repository and put their code in the root of this repository (this will be explained in class).

You can periodically pull the instructor's code into your repo (for reference, copying stuff, etc.) as well as his notes by:

- Asking the instructor to "push" his changes (if he hasn't done so recently)
- Follow the instructions for [syncing your repository](./instructor/notes/00-syncing.md).

First change of class!
