# Http

## Types of Resources

### Collection

Almost always a plural name. Represents an associated group of documents, usually.

For example:

`GET /employees`

### Document

A singular name, a leaf-level of a collection.

For example:

`GET /employees/bob-smith`

(Where `bob-smith` is the identifier for an employee)

May contain *subordinate resources*:

`GET /employees/bob-smith/manager` (A document)

`GET /employees/bob-smith/addresses` (A collection)

`GET /employees/bob-smith/addresses/home` A document

#### Special Cases

##### Store

Used to mirror client state in the server. Always associated with a specific session or user of your API.

Example might be a shopping cart. Or a quote.

Stores often become documents or collections at some point. (a shopping cart becomes an order, for example, a quote becomes a policy)

##### "Controller" or "RPC-Like"

Not everything can be modelled using resources, or it is awkward to do so.

Use these sparingly.

Example:

`POST /employees/bob-smith/vacation-requests/resubmit`

## Methods

The KEY Http Methods for API Developers are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

The Http "unsafe" methods (POST, PUT, DELETE) are a *declarative* language for a client to express their desired state.
