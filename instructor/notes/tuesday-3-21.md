# Good Morning! It's TUESDAY March 21, 2023

Please start and connect to your VM at https://labs.azure.com/virtualmachines
Password is in the chat window.

## Today

1. Please start Docker Desktop. It's the blue and white whale icon on the desktop of your VM. 
    - No need to do anything once it starts.
2. Get anyone reset that needs to reset their code for the day.
3. Domain Entities vs. Models/Representation
    - Manual "mapping"
    - Automapper
4. EntityFramework Intro
    - The Data Context
    - Migrations
    - Keeping the Database in sync with our code's idea of the database
    - Queries and logging
5. Designing representation to express intent in regards to "updates"
6. Designing and implementing "buckets" to make bullet-proof APIs
7. Sagas for long-running, multi-stage processes
8. async/await guidelines. (this includes services.)

> Note: These will not be presented in this exact order - but I want to make sure we cover these things.

> Mantra: "The solution to just about every API design challenge is to create a new resource".
